## üõ†Ô∏è General Troubleshooting

### Common First Steps
1. **Check Service Status**: `docker compose ps`
2. **View Logs**: `docker compose logs [service-name]`
3. **Check Network**: Test connectivity to cloud services
4. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure .env settings are correct

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Service status
docker compose ps

# View all logs
docker compose logs

# Service-specific logs
docker compose logs monitor-agent
docker compose logs alertmanager
docker compose logs prometheus

# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Check metrics
docker exec prometheus wget -qO- http://monitor-agent:8080/metrics | head -20
```
